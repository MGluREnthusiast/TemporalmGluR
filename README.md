# TemporalmGluR
This project involves running a simulation of the cerebellum to encode temporal memory. However, this project aims to include additional intrinsic cellular mechanisms to increase encoding capabilities and more accurately represent real world data

Currently, the project does not incorporate this mechanism in the C++ code.
Once the code is ironed out I plan on incorporating this mechanism (7/27/23)
